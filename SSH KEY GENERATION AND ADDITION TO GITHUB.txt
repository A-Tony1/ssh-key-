CREATING AND ADDING SSH KEY TO YOUR GITHUB ACCOUNT
==================================================
SSH is used to access GitHub during pulling and pushing
used for ssh authentication in GitHub
Lets you interacts with GitHub without typing a username or token each time
This is generated locally in your system

INSTRUCTIONS
 Open Git Bash and type ssh-Keygen and click enter


NOTE
 Prompt for the file name and location
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa):Just click enter if don't wish to change were you wish to save both private and pubic keys.
Prompt for a passphrase (optional but recommended)
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
You can:
Type a secure passphrase (adds another layer of protection).
Press Enter for no passphrase (less secure but convenient for automation).
Prompt to confirm the passphrase





Output summary
Your identification has been saved in /home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa
Your public key has been saved in /home/youruser/.ssh/id_rsa.pub

The key fingerprint is: could be different depending on you OS
SHA256:... youruser@hostname
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 3072]----+

| o o .           |
|  o = .          |
| .+ B = o        |
|.o= B O S        |
|*+.o = = .       |
|=++..   .        |
|*oo.E .          |
|B+=+oo.          |
+----[SHA256]-----+

 Login to you GitHub account 

Click on your profile icon and scroll to setting on the right side of your screen
On the left side of you screen scroll down to SSH and GPG Keys: you don't need the GPG key
Click and open, give name for the key, click on "NEW SSH KEY" copy the Public Key from local user folder and paste it in.

Hope this was helpful? If needed I will also guide in creating the "PERSONAL ACCESS TOKEN" for using Git over HTTPS. Thanks all..
